Strings are also sequence, i.e.  a **positionally** ordered collection of other objects.
Other types of sequences include lists, tuples. 
**NOTE:** Sets aren't sequences - they have no order and they can't be indexed via `set[index]` - they even don't have any kind of notion of indices. (They are `iterable`, though - you can iterate over their items.)
