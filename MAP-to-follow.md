I want to become a very good machine learning engineer with deep knowledge of ML and deep learning. Be a very good python programmer. 
if this doesnt motivate you, know that you could be earning 20-30 LPA by gaining this knowledge, so do it. or stay mediocre and accept that and dont unnecessarily burden yourself or set big targets. live a chill life. I know you want the money so go for it.
