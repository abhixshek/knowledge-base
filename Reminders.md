not progressing anywhere career wise. 
what have I learnt? which profile do I want to pursue? 
is there lack of desire to work? 
do you want to leave 9-5 all together? 
What do I really want to be? a python dev? an SDE? a ML Ops guy? 
data scientist?
~~ML researcher?~~  - eye issue, cannot give time to other things, too cutting edge for my style. 
~~data analyst? BI analyst?~~
1. dont think market will work all year around, it never does, never will. dont sacrifice a good career and future for meagre gains. 
2. dont like what I do at job or what my team members are doing at inno. not giving me satisfaction. 
~~trader full time~~ - nope. I want capital gains over and above my income , not to make it my only income. 

Are you really getting into business side of things? then whats the push with all the technical study in depth? no point.
